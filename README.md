# Amino Acids Counter

## Overview
This project processes CSV files exported from a protein analyzer application. The input CSV file should contain the following columns:

- **Protein Accession**
- **Start**
- **End**
- **Peptide**

From this data, the application counts the amino acids by position in the sequence and generates an interactive histogram. The histogram displays amino acid coverage, including critical regions such as CDRs (Complementarity-Determining Regions).

## Features
- Parses CSV files containing peptide sequences data
- Counts amino acid occurrences by position
- Generates an interactive histogram visualization
- Displays CDR coverage alongside amino acid frequencies

## Screenshots

## Usage
1. Provide a CSV file in the correct format.
2. View the generated histogram and analyze the CDR coverage.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flet 0.27.x
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- crowelab_pyir
